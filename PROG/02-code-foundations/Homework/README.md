## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is an important mindset as you grow your skill set as a software developer because coding is a complex skill and learning the building blocks now will set you up for success in the future.

***Orientation to Detail*** is important to learn programming because code needs to be precise and thoughtful. Maintaining focus until code is finished & paying attention to errors is valuable for any developer.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks.
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion.
