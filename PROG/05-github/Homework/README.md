## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Personal Responsibility*** is important when you learn Git because you will be assigned tasks and projects that your team is depending on you to deliver. Making sure you are able to complete your tasks and document your code is a responsibility you always have when working on a team.

***Teamwork*** is important to learn GitHub because as a software developer, you will be working with others and adding to existing codebases. Effectively working on a team means communicating what changes you are adding, asking for help when you need it, and being able to explain the purpose of the code you are writing.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks.
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion.
