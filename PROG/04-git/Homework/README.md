## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Personal Responsibility*** is important when you learn Git because you will be assigned tasks and projects that your team is depending on you to deliver. Making sure you are able to complete your tasks and document your code is a responsibility you always have when working on a team.

***Communication*** is important when you learn Git because as a software developer, you will be adding to existing codebases. Effectively communicating what changes you are adding and why you chose to do them, will help your team understand the purpose of the code you are writing and how to use it.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks.
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion.
