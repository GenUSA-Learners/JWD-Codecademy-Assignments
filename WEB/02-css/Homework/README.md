## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Persistence*** is important to learn CSS because CSS provides many ways of achieving the same visual results, and persistence will allow you to truly master CSS and fulfill high standard design requirements.

***Communication*** is important to learn CSS because you use CSS and HTML to communicate to the internet how a web page should look and feel. If your code isnâ€™t clear, you will not communicate your design correctly and your webpage will not meet your expectations.

### Performance Goals for this Unit
