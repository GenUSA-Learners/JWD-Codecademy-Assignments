## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Growth Mindset*** is important to learn HTML because with it you will realise that the more you practice and apply HTML tags and elements in real-world scenarios, the more experienced you will get, and the better youâ€™ll be to work on more complex HTML layouts.

***Orientation to Detail*** is important to learn HTML because it will help you remember the different tags and elements that make up the different parts of a web page. With orientation to detail, all the HTML elements will be correctly written and styled to create visually appealing web pages.
