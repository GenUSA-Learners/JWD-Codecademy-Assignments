## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn Unit Testing because creating unit tests when developing a new project enables a developer to catch bugs before they become a problem, and makes it much easier to scale and adapt a piece of code in the future

***Detail Orientation*** is important to learn Unit Testing because developers must be capable of catching all possible failures before they even happen, and this requires paying great amount of attention to detail

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
