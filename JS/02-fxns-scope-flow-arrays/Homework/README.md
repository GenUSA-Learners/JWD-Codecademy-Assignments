## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Persistence***  is important to learn the fundamental concepts of a programming language because there are many new concepts introduced both in logic and syntax, which are challenging. It's important to work hard to master these concepts, which will be used for most tasks looking forward

***Proactiveness***  is important to learn the fundamental concepts of a programming language because all coding tasks can be solved in many different ways. It's the developers job to own the task, analyse the different options, and create their own way of solving it

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
