## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn and apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles because this framing will be useful not only for JavaScript but also for other programming languages. Also, when applying OOP in a project, you will need to think beforehand about how your code will be reused or read in the future

***Communication*** is important to use OOP in JavaScript because when programming with object oriented principles, code will be easier to understand and easier to reuse if it is written well and communicated clearly from the start

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
