### Session 3: Asynchronous JavaScript and Requests Debrief **`SYNC`*

## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Growth Mindset*** is important to learn about Asynchronous programming because it means a big change in perspective for a junior developer. Learning a new mental model requires abandoning a fixed mindset, and being ready to improve over time

***Orientation to Detail*** is important to learn about asynchronous programming because handling requests and promises can create many execution errors that sometimes are not even in the syntax, requiring great debugging skills and a detail oriented behaviour

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
